## What is Crisis Compass?

Disasters are chaotic. People panic, information is scattered, and generic advice ignores real needs like medical conditions, go-bag readiness, or where to find shelter nearby.

**Crisis Compass** brings preparedness and response into one cohesive app. It is designed around *your* profile: blood group, medical conditions, and emergency contacts all shape the guidance you receive.

---

## Core Features

### AI Emergency Assistant
Describe your situation in plain language (e.g. *"there is smoke in my building"* or *"flood water is rising near my home"*). The assistant uses **Groq + LangChain** to return a structured, personalized action plan with:

- Assessed danger level (low to critical)
- Step-by-step immediate actions
- A list of items to carry
- Nearby shelter and hospital suggestions
- Safety tips tailored to your medical profile

### Emergency Dashboard
A real-time situational overview including:

- **Live Weather Card** fetched from external APIs
- **Dynamic Risk Badge** with active disaster alerts from GDACS and NWS
- **Shelter Locator** showing nearby shelters and hospitals on an interactive Leaflet map
- **Quick SOS** for fast access to emergency actions

### Preparedness Checklist
A household readiness tracker built on **FEMA and Red Cross** guidelines. Check off water, food, medical, documents, and evacuation items. Progress is saved per user account and synced across devices.

### Community Help Board
A real, database-backed board where users can:

- Post needs for **water**, **food**, **shelter**, or **rides**
- Browse and filter open requests by category
- Mark their own posts as fulfilled or delete them

### Offline Mode (PWA)
Crisis Compass is a fully installable **Progressive Web App**. The service worker caches core assets so that emergency checklists and guides remain accessible even when the internet goes down.
